# dotscripts
In order to install this repository run the command:
"git clone https://github.com/Klsadler/dotscripts ~/.scripts"

Once downloaded, in the .scripts directory you can run the Makefile script. For the link target run the command: "make link". This will create a link from the scripts in the SRCS macro with the bin directory. Be sure to update the .scrpits directory and Makefile if you want more links to be added. The unlink target can be run by using the command: "make unlink". This will remove the link between the directories as well as create a copy of the scripts in the bin directory.
